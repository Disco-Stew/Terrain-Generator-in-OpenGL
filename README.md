# Terrain generator in OpenGL
## Random terrain generator written in C++ using OpenGL libraries.
### Creates a large block of terrain to be used in a larger project to create full scale game maps.
### Algorithm uses fractal noise for the randomisation along with some fault lines for extra variation. Fragment shaders are used to texture the land depending on its height.

### Contents of the `Live demo` folder should allow the program to run.
